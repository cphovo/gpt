Now you are a coding callenge designer. I will give you a challenge description, you need to optimize it, make it specific to the candidate to code. Let's finish it step by step. First, look at the description:
背景：
在股票交易系统中，交易数据是动态更新的，这其中涉及到各种因素，比如交易成本、交易时间等。假设现在我们的目标是通过股票交易数据的分析，找到从一个股票到另一个股票的最优交易路径，其中路径的定义是交易成本最小。
交易数据是一种动态的数据结构，其中包含股票之间的交易数据，我们将其简化为一张有向图，其中节点代表股票，边代表从一个股票到另一个股票的交易，边的权重代表交易成本。
你的任务是设计一个程序，接受以下输入：
1. 一个有向图的邻接矩阵表示法，其中节点代表股票，边的权重代表交易成本。你可以假定图是连通的。
2. 两个股票（节点）的标识符，代表我们想要找到从源股票到目标股票的最小成本路径。
你需要返回从源节点到目标节点的最小成本路径及其成本。

Sure, here's the revised description in English:

### Challenge: Finding the Optimal Path in Stock Trade

**Background:**  
In stock trading systems, trade data is dynamic and influenced by various factors such as trading cost and trading time. Suppose we aim to analyze the stock trading data to identify the optimal trading path from one stock to another. The definition of the optimal path is that the trading cost is the smallest.

The trade data is a dynamic data structure, which includes the trade data between the stocks. We will simplify this as a directed graph where nodes represent stocks, and edges represent trades from one stock to another. The weight of an edge indicates the trading cost.

**Challenge:**

Your task is to design a program that receives the following inputs:

1. A directed graph represented by an adjacency matrix, where nodes symbolize stocks and the weights of the edges represent trading costs. You can assume that the graph is connected.
2. Two identifiers for the stocks (nodes), representing the source and target stocks between which we wish to find the path with the least cost.

**Output:**

Your program should return the minimum cost path from the source node to the target node and its cost.

**Constraints:**

1. The number of nodes n (1 <= n <= 1000), the number of edges m (1 <= m <= 1000), and the costs associated with each edge c (1 <= c <= 1000) are integers.
2. The graph is guaranteed to be connected.
3. The input stock identifiers are guaranteed to be valid nodes in the graph.
4. In the case of multiple paths with the same minimum cost, returning any one of them is acceptable.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

Your code will be evaluated based on:

1. Correctness - Your solution should provide the correct minimum cost path for all test cases.
2. Efficiency - Your solution should efficiently handle the maximum constraints of the problem.
3. Code Quality - Your code should be clean, easy to understand, and properly documented.

### Challenge: Minimum Cost Path in a Graph

**Background:** 

In many systems involving networked elements, it's essential to identify the optimal path between two points. This optimal path could be defined in various ways, such as minimum time, maximum capacity, or in this case, minimum cost.

**Challenge:**

Imagine a directed, connected graph where each edge has an associated cost. Your task is to write a program that, given a source node and a target node, calculates the minimum cost path between these nodes.

**Inputs:**

Your program should accept the following inputs:

1. A directed graph represented by an adjacency matrix. Each node in the graph represents an entity, and each edge represents a connection between these entities. The weight of an edge indicates the cost of traversing from one node to another. You can assume that the graph is connected.
2. Two identifiers for the nodes, indicating the source and target nodes. These are the nodes between which we wish to find the path with the least cost.

**Output:**

Your program should return the following:

1. The minimum cost path from the source node to the target node, represented as a sequence of nodes.
2. The total cost of this path.

**Constraints:**

1. The number of nodes `n` (1 <= n <= 1000), the number of edges `m` (1 <= m <= 5000), and the costs associated with each edge `c` (1 <= c <= 1000) are integers.
2. The graph is guaranteed to be connected.
3. The input node identifiers are guaranteed to be valid nodes in the graph.
4. In the case of multiple paths with the same minimum cost, returning any one of them is acceptable.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

Your solution will be evaluated based on:

1. Correctness - Your solution should provide the correct minimum cost path for all test cases.
2. Efficiency - Your solution should run efficiently even at the problem's maximum constraints.
3. Code Quality - Your code should be clean, well-structured, and well-documented.
